# swtGrocery

The purpose of the swtGrocery demo project is to provide a working application that highlights a number of useful
technologies for your SWL project.

* A fully configured SpringBoot-based backend and a JavaFX-based frontend.
* An included build file to compile, test, and run this project.
* Source code comments in the form of JavaDoc describing the workings of each method/class.
* Contained unit and integration tests that provide good examples on how to test the code.
* A preconfigured GitLab CI pipeline that builds/tests the software, and checks for formatting issues automatically.

See [Specification.md](doc/Specification.md) for a description of the functionality.

See [Documentation.md](doc/Documentation.md) for a description of the implementation and notes on development.
